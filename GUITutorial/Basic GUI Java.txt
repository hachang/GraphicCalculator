- Java provides a hierarchy of classes useful in creating GUI's
	
	- Everything in the hierarchy descends from the class Component
		- Useful methods such as:
			- setBackgroundColor
			- setFont
		
	- Container - next class in the hiearchy
		- defines methods that are useful for maintaining a list of components that the container stores. 
			- ex. : text boxes
			- labels, etc
			- methods: add and remove.

	- Window - hierarchy contains classes that are useful in creating windwos(known as Frames), 
	- JComponent - contains calsses that can be used to create the GUI components usd in the window.
		
		- WindowEvent - indicates that a window has changed its status.


-GUI programs often have to miport both packages, as they may use classes from each.
